{"name":"Tit Petric","tagline":"Open Source Projects / Development","body":"### Tit Petric\r\n\r\nI'm a 30-ish something application and systems developer from Slovenia. My dream job is to work at Tumblr. I like to work intelligently opposed to working hard.\r\n\r\nI love a good book, I'm a geek for sci-fi and I'm as talented for cooking as good as I am at programming. I also love taking photos and spending time with friends. I find that good friends, good wine and good food are as much as any one could ask for. I appreciate the laughs I can get.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nDevelopment blog - http://foreach.org<br/>\r\nPersonal blog - http://titpetric.tumblr.com<br/>\r\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/titpetric<br/>\r\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/titpetric\r\n\r\nYou can reach me on black@scene-si.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
